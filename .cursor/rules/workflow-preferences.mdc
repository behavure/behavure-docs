# Workflow Preferences

- Focus on areas of the codebase relevant to the task
- Do not touch code unrelated
- Avoid major changes to patterns and architecture of how a feature works after it's shown to be working well, unless explicitely instructed
- Always think about how other parts of the codebase can be impacted by code changes.
