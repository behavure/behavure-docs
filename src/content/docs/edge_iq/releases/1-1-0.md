## Summary

This release provides improvements to the visual editor, and more robust compatibility for OSX.

## UI / Visual editor

- The visual editor now providers a disable/enable button for job actions.

- The visual editor's input controls for maps - typically used to specify key-value data like fields - now supports editing existing values.

- The visual editor now cancels running jobs using the job identifier, instead of using the default index 0. This prevents multiple users from accidentally cancelling each other's transient jobs during testing.

- The visual editor's run output view contains a tooltip that better explains the behaviour of the "Capture output" option

- The visual editor's run output view has a new option to disable syntax highlighting for job output data. This can prevent browser slowdowns when rendering a lot of job output data.

- The visual editor's raw job editor will detect unsaved changes, and turn the "Close Raw Editor" button yellow. This helps closing the raw editor when changes have not been applied.

## UI / Other

- The dashboard now has a new job button
- The metrics and logs views now contains a back button. Technically it triggers the browser's "back" navigation action

## Compatibility

- Reduced the number of file handles used by the server on OSX, which has conservative file descriptor limits.
