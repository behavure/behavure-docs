LyftData Inc. – Website Terms of Use (Last Updated 11/12/2024)

These LyftData Inc. Website Terms of Use, together with any terms expressly incorporated herein by reference (“Terms”), apply to your access to and use of the website located at www.lyftdata.com (excluding any products or services accessible through this site (“Website”). These Terms are entered into by and between you (“you” or “your”) and LyftData Inc. (“LyftData”, “we”, “us” or “our”). 

These Terms do not govern the use of our software-as-a-service products and/or hosted applications, or other related services (collectively, “Services”). If you are accessing or using the Services – including through a free trial – your use is subject to our End User License Agreement (“EULA”), or any other written agreement separately entered into between you and us. We may also provide different or additional terms in relation to some of our other products and services. Those different or additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those products and services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms specific to our products or services, the additional terms will govern for that conflict.

1)	Acceptance of Terms

By using our Website, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please refrain from using our Website. We provide the information, products, and services on the Website to you, conditioned upon your acceptance, without modification, of the Terms contained herein. Your use of the Website constitutes your agreement to these Terms.

By using our Website, you represent to us that you are legally capable of entering into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of an entity, such as your employer or a company you represent, you affirm that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. In such cases, “you” as used in these Terms refers to both you as an individual and the entity you represent. LyftData and you are collectively referred to as the “Parties,” and each is individually referred to as a “Party.”
We may update these Terms from time to time. 

The “Last Updated” date above indicates when these Terms were last revised. If we make changes, we will notify you by sending an email, providing a notice through our Website, or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless stated otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Website after such notice constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Website. 

If you have a registered account on the Website (“User Account”), we may also notify you of changes by either displaying the changes when you log in to the Website or by sending the changes to the email address associated with your User Account. By continuing to use or access the Website after the updated Terms are posted or, if applicable, by not terminating your User Account within seven (7) days after receiving notice of the changes, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website or any service (or any part thereof) at any time. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such modification, suspension, or discontinuance, except as expressly provided in these Terms.

5)	Copyright Complaints

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) provides a process for copyright owners to seek recourse if they believe material available on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that any material residing on or linked from the Website infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may submit a notification of claimed infringement to legal@lyftdata.com. Your notification must include all of the following information:

- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
- Identification of the material claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Website (e.g., URL(s) of the claimed infringing material);
- Information reasonably sufficient to allow us to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address;
- A statement such as: “I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”;
- A statement such as: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”; and
- Your physical or electronic signature.

If you believe that material you posted on the Website was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification at legal@lyftdata.com. Your counter-notification must include the following information:

- A description of the material that LyftData has removed or to which access has been disabled;
- Information reasonably sufficient to allow LyftData to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address, along with a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district where your address is located (or the Southern District of New York if your address is outside of the United States) and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification of claimed infringement or an agent of such person;
- A statement such as: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled”; and
- Your physical or electronic signature.

We reserve the right to terminate access to the Website or User Accounts for users who are repeat infringers or are suspected of repeated copyright violations.

6)	Third-Party Content and External Links 

Our Website may provide, or third parties may make available, links to other websites, applications, resources, advertisements, content, or other products and services created, hosted, or offered by third parties (“Third-Party Services”). These third parties may, in turn, rely on additional third parties to provide components of the Third-Party Services, such as technology, development, or payment services. When you access or use any Third-Party Service, you are engaging with the applicable third party, not with LyftData Inc., and you do so at your own risk.

We make no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the Third-Party Services or their providers, including but not limited to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of information provided by such Third-Party Services or the privacy practices of any third party. The inclusion of any Third-Party Service or link on the Website does not constitute an endorsement, approval, or recommendation by us.

We are not responsible or liable for the content, actions, or practices of any Third-Party Service or provider, even if such Third-Party Service links to, or is linked from, the Website. You acknowledge and agree that your use of Third-Party Services is governed by the terms and policies of the respective third-party provider, and not by these Terms.

7)	User Registration and Security

Your submission of registration information and other personal data through the Website is governed by our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference.

When registering, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information on the registration form, and maintain and promptly update such registration information to ensure its accuracy and completeness. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that your information is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your User Account and restrict your access to the Website (or any portion thereof).

You may not use a username or email address that is already in use by another person, that impersonates another person, that belongs to someone else, that infringes on any intellectual property or other rights, that is offensive, or that we reject for any other reason at our sole discretion. Your username and password are for your personal use only and must not be shared with or transferred to any other person.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for all activities conducted under your User Account. You agree not to lend, transfer, or otherwise share your use of or access to the Website with any third party. You also agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your User Account or any other breach of security related to your account.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL LYFTDATA, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL LYFTDATA’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS EXCEED TWO HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS.

If you are a consumer residing in California, you also waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”

16)	Force Majeure 

Neither LyftData, nor its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners, or licensors, will be held liable for any delay or failure to fulfill any obligation under these Terms, if the delay or failure is caused by circumstances beyond their reasonable control. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, epidemics, labor disputes or industrial disruptions, utility failures (such as electricity or telecommunications), earthquakes, storms, blockades, embargoes, riots, government actions or orders, acts of terrorism, or war.

17)	Governing Law  

This Agreement and these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

From time to time, we may post job openings on the Website and/or invite users to submit resumes. By choosing to submit your name, contact details, resume, and/or other personal information to us in response to these listings, you grant us permission to use this information for lawful and legitimate hiring, employment, and business purposes. We also reserve the right, at our own discretion, to share this information with our affiliates for their legitimate business purposes.

We may send notices to you by posting on the Website, email, or regular mail, at our discretion. You agree that a printed version of these Terms and any notices provided electronically will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings in the same manner and under the same conditions as other business documents originally created and maintained in printed form.

20)	Miscellaneous 

If any provision or part of a provision in these Terms is found to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, that provision or part will be considered separate from the rest of these Terms, and its invalidity will not impact the enforceability of the remaining provisions.

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not waive that right or provision. Furthermore, our waiver of any condition, term or provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any other condition, term or provision.

These Terms represent the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter and replace all prior agreements, representations, discussions, and understandings related to this subject. 

The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and do not hold any legal or contractual significance. Unless stated otherwise, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and do not grant third-party beneficiary rights to any other individuals or entities. 

These Terms are not intended to, and should not be interpreted as, establishing any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and us. You are not permitted to assign, transfer, or sublicense any of your rights or responsibilities under these Terms without obtaining prior written consent from us.
