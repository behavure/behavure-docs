Scuba provides an external query API that you can use to programmatically send queries to Scuba and receive query results.

For some customers, Scuba is one of several analytics processes they run, and consolidating these various analyses in a single report or dashboard is important. Other customers need aggregated data from Scuba to feed into separate processes. For example, you might want to use data from Scuba queries as input to PowerBI. With the external API, you can run queries outside of the Scuba user interface.

Choose from the following methods of creating a query:

- **Create the query in the Scuba UI**. Use the query response ID from the URL to rerun the query using the API. See [Quickstart Guide: Use the Scuba API to expand on UI queries](./api-programmatically-querying-scuba/quickstart-guide-using-scubas-api-to-expand-on-ui-queries) to get started.
- **Create the query at the command line using the Scuba behavioral analytics query language, BQL**. To learn about the rich and flexible language available for querying Scuba, see [BQL syntax and usage](./api-programmatically-querying-scuba/bql-syntax-and-usage).
