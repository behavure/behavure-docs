- [Show a count of events](./show-a-count-of-events)  
  This article shows you how to create a basic "show count of events" query.
- [Show a count of actors](./show-a-count-of-actors)Determine the number of actors across all events over a set period of time.
- [Refine chart display results](./refine-displayed-results-with-chart-options)Refine the display of query results in a panel, without creating and running a new query.
- [Specify time in a query](.//specify-time-in-a-query)How Scuba handles time, and how you can use exact and relative time settings in a query.
- [Calculate measures and filters](./calculate-measures-and-filters)When you're building a Scuba query, whenever you are selecting a property, you can instead create a mathematical expression and use it in your query or property definition.
- [View query history](../../scuba-guides/scuba-tutorials/manage-objects-and-queries/view-query-history)Scuba preserves the session query history, on a per-user basis. This is helpful when you want to return to a query from the current browser session, or return to a query you ran during an earlier session. Scuba lets you view past queries with data from when the queries were originally run. You can use these queries as jumping off points from which to create new queries.
- [Visualize hierarchical data with a sunburst chart](./visualize-hierarchical-data-with-sunburst-charts-in-pie-view)Sunburst charts are an effective way to display and analyze hierarchical data. Each level of the sunburst chart (hierarchy) is shown as a ring or circle. The innermost circle is the root (or top) of the hierarchy.
