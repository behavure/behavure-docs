Use measures to create queries in Scuba to aggregate your data in different ways. Take a few minutes to review the aggregation options available in Scuba. You will be working with them when you create queries. Scuba v5 includes the following options:

| Measure Aggregation | Used in                               | Description                                                                                                                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Count Events        | - Explorer<br>- Properties<br>- Flows | A simple count of events matching the query.                                                                                            | See [Show a count of events](https://interana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSSD/pages/1302496364) or [Show a count of actors](https://interana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSSD/pages/1302332435). |
| Count Unique        | - Explorer<br>- Properties<br>- Flows | A count of unique values within a column matching the query. This measure is valid for numeric and string data.                         |                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Sum                 | - Explorer<br>- Properties<br>- Flows | The sum of the numeric values of all results returned for a query.                                                                      | - Does not work with string columns.<br>- When used with flow properties, Scuba sums per flow for flow IDs within the query's event filters.                                                  |
| Average             | - Explorer<br>- Properties<br>- Flows | The average (mean) value of a given parameter over the specified time period.                                                           | - Does not work with string columns.<br>- When used with flow properties, Scuba averages per flow for flow IDs within the query's event filters.                                              |
| Minimum             | - Explorer<br>- Properties<br>- Flows | The lowest value that matched the query at any time over the specified time period.                                                     | - Does not work with string columns.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Maximum             | - Explorer<br>- Properties<br>- Flows | The highest value that matched the query at any time over the specified time period.                                                    | - Does not work with string columns.                                                                                                                                                          |

| First, Last         | - Explorer<br>- Properties<br>- Flows | The First and Last measures return the value of a given column with the smallest (First) or largest (Last) event timestamp.             |                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Every               | - Properties                          | Create an actor or flow property that contains a list of values in a given column.                                                      | - See [Compare actor or flow properties on the fly with sets](https://interana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSSD/pages/1304560121).                                                              |
| Variance            | - Explorer                            | The statistical variance of a random value in the given numeric column from the column’s average (mean) over the specified time period. | - Does not work with string columns.                                                                                                                                                          |
