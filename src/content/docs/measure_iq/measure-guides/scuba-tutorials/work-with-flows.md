A flow helps you visualize the path of actions taken by a group of actors.

You can view the discovery paths of all [actors](https://scuba.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GLOSSARY/pages/2160230470/Actor+v5) simultaneously, investigate the events of all actors on an individual path, or use information from a flow as input in a top-level query. In this way, flows provide you with the tools to track trends and determine projected user behaviors over time.
