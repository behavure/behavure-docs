description: Definition & use of Rebalance 
---
**Rebalance** is the process of redistributing shards evenly across all eligible (non-excluded) nodes after a cluster has been resized. In most cases, you expand a cluster–adding nodes so the cluster capacity matches the growth of your data. However, you can also choose to reduce the number of nodes in a cluster.
