Measure IQ provides a behavioral analytics query language (**BQL**, or **BAQL**) that you can use with an API call to programmatically query Measure IQ.

For more information about the Measure IQ query language, see:

- [Measure IQ query concepts for BQL users](/measure_iq/measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq) for a discussion of how Measure IQ queries work, with examples of how to create these types of queries using BQL.
- [BQL syntax and usage](/measure_iq/measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq/bql-syntax-and-usage) for a description of BQL building blocks and examples of common Measure IQ queries from the UI translated into BQL.
- [BQL vs. SQL comparison](/measure_iq/measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq/compare-bql-and-sql-commands) for similarities and differences between BQL and SQL concepts.
