Measure IQ provides a behavioral analytics query language (**BQL**, or **BAQL**) that you can use with an API call to programmatically query Measure IQ.

For more information about the Measure IQ query language, see:

- [Measure IQ query concepts for BQL users](../measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq) for a discussion of how Measure IQ queries work, with examples of how to create these types of queries using BQL.
- [BQL syntax and usage](../measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq/bql-syntax-and-usage.md) for a description of BQL building blocks and examples of common Measure IQ queries from the UI translated into BQL.
- [BQL vs. SQL comparison](../measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq/compare-bql-and-sql-commands.md) for similarities and differences between BQL and SQL concepts.

For information about querying with the API, see [Use the Measure IQ external query API](../measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq/use-the-measure-iq-external-query-api.md).
