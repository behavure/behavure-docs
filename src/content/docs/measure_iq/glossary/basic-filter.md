description: Definition & use of Basic Filter 
---
Use **basic filters** in the query builder by selecting one or more columns or properties to use as a filter for your query. If you add multiple filters, they can be joined in either an `AND` or an `OR` operation. You can use raw columns from your data, or add a custom actor, event, or flow property.
