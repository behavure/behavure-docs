description: Definition & use of Views 
---
A **view** is the visualization of query results in the form of a chart, graph, table, or number, together with settings determined by Scuba to optimize that visualization. Select the view you want to use in the [Query Builder](../query-builder). This lets you visualize your results flexibly on the fly, and can alter your query directly through the [chart options](../chart-options) within the View.
