description: Definition & use of User Roles 
---
**User roles** define sets of permissions that allow individual users to perform specific tasks, such as view, create, or modify a file. A user role also defines which data its users have access to. Roles are defined according to job skills, authority, and responsibility.

Role-based access control (RBAC) regulates access to computer or network resources based on assigned user roles.
