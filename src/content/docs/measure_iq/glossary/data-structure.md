description: Definition & use of Data Structure 
---
The **data structure** is the format, organization, and way in which you store data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently. The structure of your data is important, as it can affect how long it takes to ingest into Scuba and make it available for queries. The data structure can also affect performanceâ€“the time it takes to view the results of your queries.
