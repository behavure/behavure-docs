description: Definition & use of Every
---

When you create an actor property or flow property, if you use the [Show](../show-actor-flow-property) method, you can choose from a list of aggregations. One of these aggregations is **every**, which produces a set.

An actor property that uses the **every** aggregation on a column produces a set containing all values of that column for the corresponding actor.
