description: Definition & use of Behavior 
---
A **behavior** is a series of chronological events in relation to a particular actor or cohort. The order and number of events are important, as well as the elapsed time between them. For example, we could collect chronological data from a series of events in which a shopper purchases a blue sweater within one day after following a link from an advertisement placed on a third-party website.
