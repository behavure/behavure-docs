description: Definition & use of Metric 
---
**Metrics** calculate summary statistics on any values in sets of events for [filters](../filters), time periods, [actor](../actor) journeys, [sessions](../session), and more. With Measure IQ, you can intuitively develop complex metrics based on behavior, such as conversion rates, retention rates, or users’ average time spent between specified actions, to understand your business processes and complex distributions of different types of end users.

In Measure IQ, metrics for actors and events are called [**actor properties**](../actor-property) and [**event properties**](../event-property), respectively.
