description: Definition & use of Self-Signed Certificate 
---
A **self-signed certificate** is an identity certificate signed with its own private key. With a self-signed certificate, the values of the certificate can only be trusted by the entity itself. The security of a self-signed certificate can be compromised, because the entity possesses the signing key and can generate a new certificate with different values at any time.
