description: Definition & use of Log Data 
---
**Log data** consists of files that are records of events, transactions, or messages:

- **Event logs** collect actions that take place at a specific time (timestamp) that can be used to understand user behavior, application, and system activity, or to diagnose problems.  
- **Transaction logs** gather changes to stored data that allow you to recover the database from crashes or other data errors.
- **Message logs** track (i.e. save) textual communication, both public (IRC channel/IM conference/MMO public/party chat messages) and private messages between users.
