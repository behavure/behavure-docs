title: Funnel
description: Definition & use of Funnel
---

**Funnels** specify steps to match actor journeys against any expected event flow and calculate statistics on how many actors completed each step. Funnels break down actor journeys into sub-series of events. Unlike sessions, they are defined by matching steps (specific events) rather than timeout. Funnels can also be used to find paths to, from, and between particular steps.

In Measure IQ, _funnels_ and _sessions_ are folded into [flows](../flow), with additional functionality.
