title: Number View 
description: Definition & use of Number View 
---
When the result of a query is a single numeric value, **Number** [**View**](../views) gives a clear representation that's especially useful for pinning to a [dashboard](../board-dashboard-living).

If you choose an *Offset* in the [Query Builder](../query-builder), the result for the primary query will appear and below it will show the percent change compared to your selected previous time period either in green (if there was an increase) or red (if there was a decrease).
