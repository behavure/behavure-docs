description: Definition & use of Units

In a Time chart, the **unit** is the rate at which you display the data (e.g., per hour, per day, per week). Even if the data is calculated on a weekly basis, you can set a "per day" unit to divide the calculated value by seven. This affects the scale of the values on the y-axis.
