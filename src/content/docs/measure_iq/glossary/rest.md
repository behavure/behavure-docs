**Representational state transfer (REST)** is a programming architectural style. The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation.

RESTful web services (REST-compliant Web services) allow a requesting system to access and manipulate Web resources using stateless operations. RESTful web services use HTTP methods explicitly by mapping the REST operations to HTTP methods:

- Create - POST
- Retrieve - GET
- Update - PUT
- Delete - DELETE
