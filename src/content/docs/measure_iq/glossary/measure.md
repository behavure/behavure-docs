description: Definition & use of Measure
---

A **measure** is a top-level aggregation that Measure IQ creates automatically when you create [knowledge objects (knobs)](knowledge-object-knob), (specifically [flows](flow)).

Use the [query builder](query-builder) to specify a top-level aggregation function using the Measure controls. You can create multiple measures and adjust which one(s) you want to see using [chart options](chart-options).

A measure is similar to a metric, but it is not saved as a knowledge object.
