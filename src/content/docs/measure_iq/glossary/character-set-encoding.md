description: Definition & use of Character Set (Encoding) 
---
A **character set** is a group of alphanumeric characters that can be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > . ASCII was the first character **encoding** standard.

**Character set encoding** refers to a set of characters and the way the way these characters are stored into memory. A coded character set is a character set in which each character corresponds to a unique number. The code unit size is equivalent to the bit measurement for the particular encoding.

- A code unit in US-ASCII consists of 7 bits.
- A code unit in UTF-8, EBCDIC and GB18030 consists of 8 bits.
- A code unit in UTF-16 consists of 16 bits.
- A code unit in UTF-32 consists of 32 bits.
