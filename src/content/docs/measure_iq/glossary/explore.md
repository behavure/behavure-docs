*See also:* ***Explorer, Visual Explorer***

The **Explore** tab is the core portal into your data, the primary way to ask ad-hoc questions in Measure IQ. It has two panels: the query builder and the visualization window. This is where users build new queries and iterate from queries they drilled into from a board (dashboard), such as changing the visualization.
