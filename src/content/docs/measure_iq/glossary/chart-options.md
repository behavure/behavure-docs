description: Definition & use of Chart Options 
---
Use the **Chart Options** menu to change the parameters of your query and adjust each view at a granular level across multiple dimensions. Results are calculated on the fly, making it easy to sample or not sample data, add another y-axis, plot splines, lines, or dots, and control time window, ranges, and chart resolution. Different views give you different ways to adjust how your query results are presented. Â
