description: Definition & use of Resize 
---
**Resize** refers to adjusting the size of a cluster by increasing or reducing the number of nodes. In most cases, a cluster will be expanded by adding nodes so the cluster capacity matches the growth of the data. However, a cluster can also be resized to reduce the number of nodes.
