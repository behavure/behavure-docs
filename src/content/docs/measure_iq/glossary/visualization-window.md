description: Definition & use of Visualization Window 
---
The **visualization window** presents the results of your exploration through a [View](../views). It includes:

- Visualization of your query results.
- A text-based translation of the query you formed in the [Query Builder](../query-builder).
- Statistics about your query.
- Tools for adjusting the visual display and working with the data.

The type of visualization (chart, graph, etc.) and the tools available depend on the View selected in the Query Builder.
