**Ingest** is the process of uploading data into Scuba. Scuba supports the following methods of ingesting data:

- Streaming ingest: A dynamic flow of live data, a high volume of data received via HTTP from a web or cloud source. 
- Continuous ingest: A cron job that pushes content into the cluster at a steady (data-in-motion) rate.
- Import: A file or batch of files (static data, data-at-rest) transferred at a prescribed time.
