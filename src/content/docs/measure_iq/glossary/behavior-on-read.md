description: Definition & use of Behavior-on-Read 
---
**Behavior-on-read** is Measure IQ's strategy of analyzing behavior as it rapidly scans data from disk. Measure IQ goes beyond row-level field extraction and summarization. Measure IQ aggregates behavioral insights per actor and for the population as a whole. Additionally, Measure IQ maintains state and gathers insights across actor journeys. Measure IQ’s strategy doesn't depend on pre-aggregating data as this limits flexibility and slows the exploration process. The Behavior-on-Read method gives less technical users more flexibility and power by making queries on newer/changed constructs just as fast as those that were previously defined. Lastly, Behavior-on-Read strengthens Measure IQ’s ability to work with multiple types of actors within the same dataset and not limit behavioral analysis to a single population of "user."
