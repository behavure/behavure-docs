title: Session
description: Definition & use of Session
---

A **session** is a sequence of consecutive events associated with a single actor. A session is identified as all events that occur during a period of activity bounded by periods of inactivity. Sessions divide and filter actor journeys into sub-series of events. Measure IQ then computes statistics on session counts, durations, and numbers of events.

In Measure IQ, _funnels_ and _sessions_ are folded into [flows](../flow), with additional functionality.
