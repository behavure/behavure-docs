title: Session 
description: Definition & use of Session 
---
A **session** is a sequence of consecutive events associated with a single actor. A session is identified as all events that occur during a period of activity bounded by periods of inactivity. Sessions divide and filter actor journeys into sub-series of events. Scuba then computes statistics on session counts, durations, and numbers of events.

In Scuba, *funnels* and *sessions* are folded into [flows](../flow), with additional functionality.
