**Per-actor metrics** calculate how many times an event occurs during a specified period of time. For example:

- How many times per day callers hang up while waiting on hold
- Number of users were active out of a 7 day period
- Number of unique products a user has viewed over the last year

Measure IQ displays per-actor metrics as `metric  <metric name>` in lists.

Measure IQ enables you to create per-actor metrics in a number of ways. You can create queries to measure metrics to analyze the characteristics of different actors, or filter to compare subsets of actors based on ad-hoc criteria.
