description: Definition & use of Segment 
---
There are two definitions of **segment** or **cohorts**, applicable in Scuba:

1. A group of [actors](../actor) that share a definition, ie the same demographic, behavior, or other characteristic. Also known as a cohort. Segments can be created in v5 using an [actor property](../actor-property), a [flow](../flow), or [flow property](../flow-property).
2. A third-party data platform enterprise that integrates with Scuba.
