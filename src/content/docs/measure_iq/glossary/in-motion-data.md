**In motion data**, or **data in motion**, refers to data when it is moving from one place to another over a network. Measure IQ supports the following methods of data in motion when ingesting data:

- Streaming ingest: A dynamic flow of live data, a high volume of data received via HTTP from a web or cloud source.
- Continuous ingest: A cron job that pushes content into the cluster at a steady (data-in-motion) rate.
- Ad hoc import: A file or batch of files (static data, data-at-rest) transferred at a prescribed time.
