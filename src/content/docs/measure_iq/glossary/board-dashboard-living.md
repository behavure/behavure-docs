description: Definition & use of Board, Dashboard (living)
---

**Boards** provide a space to collect and organize queries as visual panels. Boards are "living" because their panels are dynamic, running directly on raw events. You can update the panel display instantly. You can also choose to adjust the underlying query parameters and quickly view the new results.

Boards act as waypoints during your data exploration. They are a holding ground for evolving queries that visually represent user stories. A board allows you to explore your data, pin the results as a new panel, and share your board with other members of your team.

Boards are also known as *dashboards*.
