**Structured data** is the format and organization of how data is stored, so it can be accessed and modified efficiently. The structure of your data is important. Data structure directly affects how long ingest takes, which in turn impacts how quickly data is made available for queries. Data structure can also affect performanceâ€”the time it takes to view the results of your queries.
