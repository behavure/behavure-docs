title: Flow
description: Definition & use of Flow
---

A **flow** is a sequence of events that an actor performs. Flows are a powerful way to analyze user behavior and understand how users move through your product or service. A flow can be as simple as two steps (for example, "View Product" followed by "Add to Cart") or as complex as needed to understand your users' behavior.

Flows are similar to funnels, but more flexible. While funnels are typically used to measure conversion through a fixed set of steps, flows can be used to understand any sequence of events, including:

- Conversion through a fixed set of steps (like funnels)
- Common paths that users take through your product
- Paths that lead to a specific outcome
- Paths that start from a specific event

Each instance of a flow is called a [flow instance](flow-instance). Flow instances can be used to understand how many times a flow occurred, how long it took to complete, and what variations occurred in the sequence of events.
