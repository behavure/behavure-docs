title: Every X Trailing Y 
description: Definition & use of Every X Trailing Y 
---
In a Time chart, "**every X**" represents the [resolution](../resolution) (frequency of points on the chart), and "**trailing y**" represents the rolling window of time for each point (how much data is aggregated for each point on the resolution). For example, "every day trailing 3 days" means that you'll be showing a data point for each day in your time range and each of those data points aggregates the last three days of data.
