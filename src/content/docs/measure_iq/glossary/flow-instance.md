title: Flow Instance 
description: Definition & use of Flow Instance 
---
A **flow instance** is an individual actor's path through a flow. For example, you could define a shopping cart flow that ends with a purchase. An individual actor might go through the flow once or several times. Each time the actor goes through the flow is a flow instance. When you define a flow property, it returns one value per flow instance.
