description: Definition & use of Event
---

**Events** are data representing an action taken by an [actor](../actor) (for example, a user or sensor). An event can be almost anything–a web conversion, an online purchase, a click on a web page, and more. Each event is described by a row of event data and can have many different attributes (also known as properties), but always has a timestamp and an actor.
