description: Definition & use of Retention 
---
Use Scuba’s **retention** analysis to measure how long new users engage with your service after registration. You can also track this engagement over time. Scuba’s retention analysis reveals how long a user is spending with your product or service, when the user stops using it, and when the user re-engages. This helps you learn which features are sticky, which features are turning away users, and the level of customer loyalty.
