If you have Edit permissions for a property, you can change the name that displays in the UI for any event property, actor property, flow, flow property, or measure. This does **not** include the ability to change the display name for raw event properties (columns ingested directly from the raw data), unless you are a cluster admin.

To edit the name of a property:

1. Click **Data**. Click the tab for the type of property whose name you wish to edit.
2. Click the property name to open its definition in the drawer to the right.
3. At the top of the results drawer pane, edit the property name.
4. Click **Save** at the top right.

Your property's new name now displays in all lists in the UI. Be sure to add the renaming to any external data dictionary you maintain.
