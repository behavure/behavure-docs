The query palette is a quick way to create new [properties](/measure_iq/glossary/event-property) and [flows](/measure_iq/glossary/flow) in your queries. You can create an object inline while you are constructing a query, rather than navigating away to create the property in the **Data** section of the UI.

Access the palette at the top right of the **Explore** view, as shown below.

**Tips for using the query palette:**

- To clear the query palette, simply click the drawer button. The palette is also cleared when you start a new session, navigate away from the query builder, or refresh your page. To find properties you have created, type their names in the *Filtered To* field in the query builder.
- Objects saved in the query palette can be revisited or reused for your query at any time. They are available for filtering and can be reviewed and edited via the data dictionary.
