Measure IQ provides an external query API that you can use to programmatically send queries to Measure IQ and receive query results.

For some customers, Measure IQ is one of several analytics processes they run, and consolidating these various analyses in a single report or dashboard is important. Other customers need aggregated data from Measure IQ to feed into separate processes. For example, you might want to use data from Measure IQ queries as input to PowerBI. With the external API, you can run queries outside of the Measure IQ user interface.

Choose from the following methods of creating a query:

- **Create the query in the Measure IQ UI**. Use the query response ID from the URL to rerun the query using the API. See [Quickstart Guide: Use the Measure IQ API to expand on UI queries](/measure_iq/measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq/quickstart-guide-using-measure-iqs-api-to-expand-on-ui-queries) to get started.
- **Create the query at the command line using the Measure IQ behavioral analytics query language, BQL**. To learn about the rich and flexible language available for querying Measure IQ, see [BQL syntax and usage](/measure_iq/measure-user-guides/api-programmatically-querying-measure-iq/bql-syntax-and-usage).
